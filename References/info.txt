whilst developing the bot
================================================

1. NS_thesis - Is a book type material contains every single step to follow along with necessary equations and information
               required for developing the bot
               Contains info about RL, MDP to make decisions and also info about the Naiva Bayes approach

2. POKI - Is the full fledged documentation of the first poker bot ever made named "POKI"
          # Also contains a diagramatic description about the poker bot architecture

3. Creating-NL-TexasHold'em Poker - Is a stanford paper on creating a poker bot by
                                    # They used a data set of hands thereby performing a supervised learning for the bot.
                                    # manipulating the NB model
                                    # using MDP and SVM's for decision process
